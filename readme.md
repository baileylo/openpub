# OpenPub V2

OpenPub is a markdown based blogging system.

The original version of OpenPub was too experimental in the way it
handled everything. This made the code base difficult if not unpleasant
to work with. My goal of OpenPub 2 is to continue developing of an
easy and expendable blogging platform, but to build features that won't
inhibit adoption and future development.
